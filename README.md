# ParkingAssistStopLight
A stop light to help you park in the perfect position every time!

* I have commented the code fairly well but if there is anywhere where it is not clear please feel free to reach out to me and I will be more than happy to update it.

* The box was printed with black PLA filament.
* The filter was printed with white silk PLA filament
* The LEDs need to be flat top leds the rounded ones focus the light too much and will not illuminate the whole area of the filter.
* If you don't have any flat top LEDs then you can sand a regular rounded LED down until the top is flat.
* I used Hotglue to attach all the components as well as the front face together and it has worked well so far.
* If you have any suggestions on how to improve the code or add additional features please let me know!
